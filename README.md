👋 Hi, I’m @marrrie23! Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Digital Humanities, where I explore the intersection of technology and the humanities.

👀 I’m interested in the application of data analysis, machine learning, and digital tools in cultural and linguistic research.

🌱 I'm currently learning advanced text mining techniques, data analysis, and visualization. I'm also delving into the ethical aspects of technology in humanities research.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage technology to enhance our understanding of human history and culture. I'm especially interested in projects related to cultural data analysis.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me at m.kutepova@student.rug.nl.
